**Exercise 4**
1. Since there is not much knowledge provided in terms of the floor layout, the default approach would be using linear search (O(n)). This means walking left, and checking each room one by one, until I reach room EY128. This is the same as iterating through each element of an unsorted list. In terms of efficiency, however, it is not the best case-- especially if EY128 is at the end. However, given the limited knowledge, a linear search would be the best to use in this case.
2. A "step" is referred to any sort of decision or movement that is made during the search for the room. Since the knowledge provided is rather limited, I would initially follow the sign that says EY100-130. I would check each room as I go until I reach the desired room. That being said, it would require 15 steps until I reach my decision (the decision being made on the 15th room).
3. This is not a best case scenario, seeing that it would take so many steps for me to be able to reach the room. The best case scenario would be having the room right next to the sign, and not having to make that many decisions to walk much or find the room. However, it is not the worst case scenario either, as the room is not the furthest away from the entrance. Therefore, the scenario is somewhere in between.
4. As mentioned previously, the best case scenario would be having the destination immediately in front of me as I enter (right next to the sign on the left side). This would mean that the time complexity is O(1). Nonetheless, a worst case scenario would be having the furthest room from the entrance (i.e. being on the far right side of where I am standing). Essentially, I would have to walk past all the rooms sequentially in order to find it. It would require the maximum amount of steps/decisions. In terms of time complexity, this is equivalent to it being O(n).
5. To improve the algorithm after memorizing the floor layout, I would use an interpolation search method. This algorithm would estimate where the target would be based on its value that is relative to the range. Essemtially, since the rooms increase at a constant rate, I can use interpolation search to go to a position that is close to EY128, which is far more efficient than starting from the left of the room and going past so many rooms. Instead, I could start somewhere on the right side, and be able to find the room a lot faster through implementing this algorithm.
